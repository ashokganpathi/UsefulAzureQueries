1. If you don't know the Azure table to search for, use this:
search in (*) "<expression you're looking for>" 

e.g. search in (*) "www.<website>.com" | summarize count() by $table 
gives the list of tables that have the given expression along w/ the counts.

2. Find
find in (AzureDiagnostics) where * has "www.<website>.com"
 project pack(*)
 
 // this query calculates request duration percentiles and count by name
let start=now(-1d);
let end=now();
let timeGrain=1h;
let dataset=requests
// additional filters can be applied here
| where timestamp > start and timestamp < end 
| where url contains "www.<website>.com"
| where operation_Name startswith "GET <URL>";
dataset
// change 'operation_Name' on the below line to segment by a different property
| summarize sum(itemCount), avg(duration) by operation_Name, bin(timestamp, timeGrain)
// calculate duration percentiles and count for all requests (overall)
| render timechart

-----------------------------------

// this query calculates request duration percentiles and count by name
let start=now(-1d);
let end=now();
let timeGrain=1h;
let dataset=requests
// additional filters can be applied here
| where timestamp > start and timestamp < end 
| where url contains "www.<website>.com"
| where operation_Name startswith "GET <URL>";
dataset
// change 'operation_Name' on the below line to segment by a different property
| summarize sum(itemCount), avg(duration) by operation_Name, bin(timestamp, timeGrain)
// calculate duration percentiles and count for all requests (overall)
| render timechart


in the chart, select "don't split" on the Operation_Name dropdown, and then on the y-axis (defaulted as sum_ItemCount) check all metrics (sum_count and avg_duration)

Query to get 500 errors

let start=now(-1h);
let end=now();

requests
// additional filters can be applied here
| where timestamp > start and timestamp < end
| where url contains "www.<website>.com"
//| where operation_Name startswith "GET <URL>";
| where (resultCode startswith "5" )
| summarize count() by url , resultCode
| sort by count_ desc
| take 50
